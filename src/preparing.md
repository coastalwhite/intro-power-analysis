This chapter expects the reader to have a personal computer
(running a modern version of *Windows*, *macOS* or a commonly used *GNU/Linux*
distribution) to which one has root/administrator permissions. Furthermore,
especially for *macOS* and *GNU/Linux*, a basic understanding of the shell is
recommended.

Although working with the [ChipWhisperer] requires little setup, it has some
prerequisites. Apart from the usual text editor and [Python], we need to install
some libraries and toolchains. What we need to install also depends on what we
want to achieve with this walkthrough. So the next few sections are going to
take you through some common necessities. Along with some of the things that
could come in handy whilst following this walkthrough.
