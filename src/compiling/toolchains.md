In order to compile code which is usable for our specific microprocessor
architecture, we need to toolchain for that architecture. As said in the
[introduction chapter](../intro.md), this walkthrough is using the [CW Lite Arm]
variant and therefore here we will show how to install the [ARM toolchain]. For
other toolchains, have a look at the [ChipWhisperer
documentation](https://chipwhisperer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/prerequisites.html#compilers).

## Installing the ARM toolchain

Information on the ARM can be found
[here](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads).

### Windows and macOS

For *Windows* and *macOS*, the installer on the [ARM developer
website](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads)
should be enough to install the ARM embedded toolchain.

### GNU/Linux

For [Debian] based systems, including [Ubuntu], we can use the following command
to install the ARM embedded toolchain.

```bash
sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi
```

For [ArchLinux] based systems, including [Manjaro], we can use the following
command to install the ARM embedded toolchain.

```bash
sudo pacman -S arm-none-eabi-gcc
```

## Compiling binaries

With the proper toolchain installed, we can compile binaries which are going to
used on the [ChipWhisperer] *targets*. All resources mentioned in the the
[Existing resources](./resources.md) section contain a *Makefile* in their root
directory. This file provides the computer instructions on how to compile
binaries. In order to create `.hex` files for our binaries, we can simply run
the following command from the root directory of our *target* project and
replacing `<PLATFORM>` with the [proper
platform](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coastalwhite/simpleserial-c-template/main/PLATFORMS.md).

```bash
PLATFORM=<PLATFORM> make
```

This should create the `.hex` file in the root directory.

We have now installed the proper toolchain and learned how to compile our own
source code. Next up, we want to know how to properly write our source code, so
we can best do our measurements.
