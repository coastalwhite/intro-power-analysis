# Sidenote: Optimizing our algorithm

As you may have noticed our algorithm is now really slow. This is due to the
calculation of [Pearson Correlation Coefficient]s. We can speed this up by a lot
if we notice a couple of things.

1. \\(\sqrt{a}\sqrt{b}=\sqrt{a b}\\). Since square rooting is a very expensive
   operation, we can optimize the calculation of \\(\sigma_x \sigma_y\\) from
   two square root calculations to one.
2. We are recalculating a lot of averages and standard deviations. We can
   precompute these averages and [standard deviation]s and them fetch them instead
   of recomputing them.
3. Since we only care about the maximum [correlation coefficient] and have no
   interest in the value itself, we can stop doing any factorization.

In the following code we have created a function which applies these three
optimized functions when calculating the [correlation coefficient]s.
