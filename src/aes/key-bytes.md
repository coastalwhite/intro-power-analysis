# Crack individual key-bytes

With the power usage model we described in the previous chapter, we can now
start to do some analysis of our power traces.

Let look what we have up until now.

```python
{{#include code/common.py:start}}
```

In order to load the data we created with our trace we can add the follow few
lines which will load in the [numpy] arrays.

```python
{{#include code/common.py:load_data}}
```

## Are we data-scientists yet?

We want to change the data in such a way that it makes it easier to identify
whether a our __modeled power usage is similar to the actual power usage__. We
need multiple power traces for this. The most important processing of data is
going to be using [Pearson correlation coefficient]s.

### Pearson correlation coefficient

Let us move these formulas to [Python].

```python
{{#include code/unoptimized_common.py:pearson_basic}}
```

Although this code is very inefficient, and does a lot of unnecessary and double
calculations, it will serve well for now. We are going to be optimizing this
code in [Sidenote: optimizing our algorithm](./optimization.md).

### Cracking a single byte

As explained in [Modeling AES](./modeling.md), we can — using [power analysis] —
__crack the [AES] key byte by byte__. So let us start with a single one. We are
going to go through every possibility and see which byte one provides the
highest [correlation coefficient] between the actual power trace and our modeled
power usage. The important realization here is that we are doing a correlation
between all individual power trace points and the hypothetical power consumption
and we will select the maximum correlation coefficient for all sub-key guesses.
This is because we still have no idea where within the power trace the first
round actually takes place. If we look at all points of each power trace, the
location where the first round takes place should have the highest correlation.
We will demonstrate this later on.

```python
{{#include code/single_byte.py:additional_imports}}

{{#include code/unoptimized_common.py:calc_correlations}}

{{#include code/single_byte.py:loop_single_byte}}
```

This will determine the maximum [correlation coefficients] for all sub-key guesses.
If we plot this we get the following graph.

```python
{{#include code/single_byte.py:plot_single_byte}}
```

_Figure 1: The [AES] Correlation Coefficients for the first sub-key values_

Remember I used the key `H4ck3rm4n-l33t42`, where `H` or ASCII 72 is the first
sub-key byte. If you used a different key, your plot will most probably look
different and there will be a high spike at the ASCII value of your first
sub-key.

Well done! We have cracked our first sub-key!
